## Description

Enhance the init flow to optionally install a specialized Claude Code agent for backlog.md task management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] New question added after agent guidelines in init flow
- [x] Agent file copied to project's .claude/agents/ directory when selected
- [x] project-manager-backlog.md properly embedded in backlog bundle
- [x] Installation is optional and clearly explained to users

## Implementation Plan

1. Add project-manager-backlog.md import to guidelines/index.ts
2. Create installClaudeAgent function in agent-instructions.ts
3. Add Claude agent prompt after agent guidelines selection in init command
4. Install agent to project's .claude/agents/ directory (not user home)
5. Add tests for the installation functionality

## Implementation Notes

- Created symlink from .claude/agents/project-manager-backlog.md to src/guidelines/
- Added CLAUDE_AGENT_CONTENT export to guidelines/index.ts for bundling
- Added installClaudeAgent function that installs to project root, not user home
- Integrated prompt into init flow after agent guidelines selection
- Added comprehensive tests for agent installation
- Updated .gitignore to track .claude/agents while ignoring rest of .claude
