## Description

Added comprehensive health check API endpoint that was needed for web UI monitoring but was not in the original scope. This endpoint provides system status, response times, and component health checks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement /api/health endpoint with proper response format
- [x] Include system status (healthy/unhealthy) in response
- [x] Add response time measurement for performance monitoring
- [x] Include filesystem and config health checks
- [x] Add proper CORS headers for cross-origin access
- [x] Provide timestamp in ISO format for monitoring tools
- [x] Handle errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
- [x] Include project name in health response

## Implementation Notes

This endpoint was implemented to support the web UI health monitoring system. While not explicitly required by tasks 118-119, it became necessary when building a production-ready web interface. The implementation includes comprehensive health checks, performance metrics, and proper error handling with CORS support.
