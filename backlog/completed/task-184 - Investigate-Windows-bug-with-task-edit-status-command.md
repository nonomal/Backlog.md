## Description

There is a reported Windows bug where the command `backlog task edit 123 -s "In progress"` doesn't work correctly. The command fails with an error message "too many arguments for 'edit'. Expected 1 argument but got 2." This issue may be related to quote handling or status parsing on Windows systems.

The task is to verify if this command works correctly on Windows and identify the root cause if it fails.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Verify the exact error message and reproduction steps
- [x] Identify the root cause of the argument parsing issue
- [x] Test various argument orders and quote combinations
- [x] Ensure the fix works for all supported command variations
- [x] Verify no regression in other CLI functionality
- [x] Confirm all tests pass after the fix

## Implementation Notes

### Root Cause Found
The issue was caused by a conflict between Commander.js command definitions:
1. Specific command: `.command("edit <taskId>")` with `-s` for setting status
2. Fallback command: `.argument("[taskId]")` that was missing filtering options

When the fallback command didn't support the same options as the list command, it would incorrectly reject valid filtering arguments, causing the "too many arguments" error.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed conflicting options** from fallback command to prevent option parsing conflicts
2. **Added command filtering** to prevent fallback from handling reserved command names like "list"
3. **Fixed parent task validation** to be consistent with other error handling (exit code 1)

### Test Results
All command variations now work correctly on Windows:
- `task edit 184 -s "Done" -a "MrLesk" --priority high` ✅
- `task edit -s "Done" -a "MrLesk" 184 --priority high` ✅ (options before taskId)
- `task list --sort priority` ✅ (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW → no priority)
- `task list --sort invalid` ✅ (proper error and exit code 1)
- All CLI functionality preserved while fixing Windows argument parsing issues
- All 444 tests now pass (was 443 pass, 1 fail)
