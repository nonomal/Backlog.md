## Description

Discovered and fixed 64 failing tests due to data model inconsistencies between description/content vs body properties. This required extensive refactoring of test files and ensuring proper serialization across the entire codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Fix property name inconsistencies in Task objects (description -> body)
- [x] Fix property name inconsistencies in Document objects (content -> body)
- [x] Fix Decision ID double-prefixing issue in filesystem operations
- [x] Update all test files to use correct property names
- [x] Fix markdown serialization and parsing consistency
- [x] Ensure all 412 tests pass without failures
- [x] Fix gray-matter serialization issues
- [x] Standardize data model across CLI and web components

## Implementation Notes

This was a significant undertaking that revealed systemic data model inconsistencies throughout the codebase. The work involved: 1) Fixing 40+ test files with property name mismatches, 2) Correcting serialization issues in filesystem operations, 3) Implementing missing server endpoints, 4) Ensuring consistency between CLI and web data models. This work was essential for code quality but was not anticipated in the original scope.
