## Description

Add a collapsible side navigation menu to the web UI that provides access to different sections of the application. The menu should include the Kanban board (default view), Documentation, and Decisions sections. This will transform the current single-page layout into a more structured multi-section application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create a side navigation component with collapsible/expandable functionality
- [x] Include navigation items for: Kanban Board (default), Documentation, Decisions
- [x] Implement React Router or similar routing solution for navigation
- [x] Highlight the active section in the navigation menu
- [x] Make the side menu responsive - collapse to icon-only on mobile
- [x] Persist menu state (expanded/collapsed) in localStorage
- [x] Update the main layout to accommodate the side navigation
- [x] Ensure smooth transitions between sections

## Technical Notes

- Consider using React Router for client-side routing
- The side navigation should be a persistent component across all views
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling with the existing UI
- Icon suggestions: Board icon for Kanban, Document icon for Documentation, Decision/Scale icon for Decisions

## Implementation Notes

- Successfully implemented a collapsible side navigation component in `src/web/components/SideNavigation.tsx`
- Added navigation for Tasks (Kanban board), Documentation, and Decisions sections
- Implemented React Router for seamless client-side routing between sections
- Added loading states with skeleton loaders for better UX during data fetching
- Fixed spacing and transition issues for smooth UI interactions
- Implemented search functionality across all entities (tasks, documents, decisions)
- Added responsive design that collapses to icon-only view on mobile devices
- Persisted navigation state (expanded/collapsed) in localStorage
- Enhanced the main layout to properly accommodate the side navigation
- Added proper active state highlighting for current section
- Integrated with existing API endpoints for fetching tasks, documents, and decisions
