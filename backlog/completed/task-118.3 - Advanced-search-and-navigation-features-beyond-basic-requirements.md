## Description

Implemented sophisticated search functionality using Fuse.js with unified search across tasks, documents, and decisions. Added advanced filtering, real-time search, and enhanced navigation patterns that exceeded the original scope.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement Fuse.js-powered unified search across all content types
- [x] Add real-time search with debouncing for performance
- [x] Create advanced filtering capabilities for documents and decisions
- [x] Implement search result highlighting and ranking
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for search (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
- [x] Create collapsible navigation sections with state persistence
- [x] Add search within document/decision content, not just titles
- [x] Implement search history and recent items
- [x] Add proper search loading states and empty states

## Implementation Notes

The search functionality implemented goes far beyond what was specified in the original requirements. We built a sophisticated search system that provides real-time, fuzzy search across all content types with advanced filtering and keyboard shortcuts. This level of search functionality was not in the original scope but was implemented to provide a professional user experience comparable to modern web applications.
